The Technical Debt phenomenon, despite being introduces by Ward Cunningham in 1992 \cite{first_mention_of_TD}, still attracts efforts of Academia and Practioners. In fact, its multi-faceted nature poses challenging problems with no easy solutions. Firstly, it manifests in every aspect of the Software's lifecycle and side effects of correlations between these different sub-dimension are often hard to identify and/or quantify. Especially because, to date, there is no definition of TD that encompasses every aspect of this problem. Secondly, its impact is greatly context dependent and, hence, universal solutions are still not in our grasp.
