%This paper assess the cost of technical debt and interest for common sub-items that allow source code to decay over time. They estimate the time taken and consequently the cost of reducing the debt within acceptable levels. These level depend on the interest related with any of these items. However, the interest ratios are arbitrary.

%This study indicates that the validity of the deinition of code smells is applicable to domain-specific systems. It however requires some tailoring to be perfectly functional.
