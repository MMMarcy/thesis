%This study encourages practioners to narrow the scope of what technical debt is. In the author opinion, in fact, diluting too much the technical debt notion brings several drawbacks. E.g. overstimating the actual debt might force the steering group to not undertake some activities that could instead be done.

%This study instead uses a definition of technical debt based on a quality perpesctive. In their view TD is whatever affects the desired level of quality. However, they narrow the scope considering TD only things belonging to the technical environment. Therefore TD items like knowledge debt fall outside this definition.

%The paper is of course about managing technical debt. However, its definition of Technical Debt is refers to the difference between the current state of the system and a hypothetical ideal version of it.

%The paper, TOGETHER WITH THE NEXT ONE, crafted a broad but detailed definition of technical debt with many sub-items. It is useful for this thesis since I can use it to frame what testing debt and source code debts are and also for the snowballing papers. However, for the second paper it is kinda of outdated and I must mention the recent interess of academia on the topic.
