% The authors examinate GUI test scripts code. They report similarities between test code and actual software. Both in the cases of "bad smells" and refactoring techniques. However, they also individued a couple of bad smells unique of GUI test scripts. However, I need to find more reliable sources to be able to link test source code to software source code. In fact the description of their experiment lacks whatsoever statistical significance. E.g. no sample size, no p-value provided etc. But if I manage to find something else it will indeed be relevant to support my point
